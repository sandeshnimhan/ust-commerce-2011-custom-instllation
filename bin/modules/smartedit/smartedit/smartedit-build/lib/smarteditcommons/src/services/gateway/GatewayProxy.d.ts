 * @ngdoc service
 * @name smarteditCommonsModule.service:GatewayProxy
 *
 * @description
 * To seamlessly integrate the gateway factory between two services on different frames, you can use a gateway
 * proxy. The gateway proxy service simplifies using the gateway module by providing an API that registers an
 * instance of a service that requires a gateway for communication.
 *
 * This registration process automatically attaches listeners to each of the service's functions (turned into promises), allowing stub
 * instances to forward calls to these functions using an instance of a gateway from {@link
 * smarteditCommonsModule.service:GatewayFactory gatewayFactory}. Any function that has an empty body declared on the service is used
 * as a proxy function. It delegates a publish call to the gateway under the same function name, and wraps the result
 * of the call in a Promise.

     * @param {String=} gatewayId The gateway ID to use internaly for the proxy. If not provided, the service <strong>must<strong> have a gatewayId property.
